# Experimental Results Viewer

## How to Use

Run the `.m` script starting with `total` in each folder to view the experimental results.  
You can retrain the model by running the Python file that starts with "train".  
Due to the existence of randomness, there may be some deviation between the results of each experiment.

## Environment Setup

It is recommended to use `conda` to create an isolated environment. Then, install the required dependencies using the command below:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
